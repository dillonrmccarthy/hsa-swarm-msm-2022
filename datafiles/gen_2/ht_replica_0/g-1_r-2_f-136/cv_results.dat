# this data file was made with 
# Chains E,F,G,H are on residues 50-69 of chains A through D (present only in the C8 cage models!)
# Chains I,J,K,L are on residues 10-29 of chains A through D (present in both C4 and C8 cage models)
# this script generates CV's for the shotgun simulation restarts
# [frame, distance along z cordinate of protein (0 is center), distance protein is away from the center of the top of the cage in the plane]
